# Exam-Management-System

Hello Peeps!😀
 Well, this is my first "python based project activity", a simple and a decent one.If you are looking for a sample ref. for your school(11th/12thGrade) activity,then here you are..




# Certain requirements:

1)Install "Tabulate" module in the PythonScripts directory using the command ``` pip install tabulate```

2)Copy the folder _CSprojectmodules ,to your python Lib directory.

3)Make sure the files StudentFile.dat and ResultFile.dat are in the same directory as Exam Management.py

# NOTE: 1)Make sure you font is atleast 13, since the tables are huge.
#        2) This ExamManagementSystem is for 12th Grade Students(As per the validations)
